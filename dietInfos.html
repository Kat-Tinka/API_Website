         <h5 >Gluten Free</h5>
      <p>Eliminating gluten means avoiding
      wheat, barley, rye, and other gluten-containing grains and foods made from
      them (or that may have been cross contaminated).</p>
      <h5>Ketogenic</h5>
      <p>The keto diet
      is based more on the ratio of fat, protein, and carbs in the diet rather
      than specific ingredients. Generally speaking, high fat, protein-rich
      foods are acceptable and high carbohydrate foods are not. The formula we
      use is 55-80% fat content, 15-35% protein content, and under 10% of
      carbohydrates.</p>
      <h5>Vegetarian</h5>
      <p>No ingredients may contain meat or meat
      by-products, such as bones or gelatin.</p>
      <h5>Lacto-Vegetarian</h5>
      <p>All ingredients
      must be vegetarian and none of the ingredients can be or contain egg.</p>
      <h5>Ovo-Vegetarian</h5>
      <p>All ingredients must be vegetarian and none of the
      ingredients can be or contain dairy.</p>
      <h5>Vegan</h5>
      <p>No ingredients may contain meat
      or meat by-products, such as bones or gelatin, nor may they contain eggs,
      dairy, or honey.</p>
      <h5>Pescetarian</h5>
      <p>Everything is allowed except meat and meat
      by-products - some pescetarians eat eggs and dairy, some do not.</p>
      <h5>Paleo</h5>
      <p>Allowed ingredients include meat (especially grass fed), fish, eggs,
      vegetables, some oils (e.g. coconut and olive oil), and in smaller
      quantities, fruit, nuts, and sweet potatoes. We also allow honey and maple
      syrup (popular in Paleo desserts, but strict Paleo followers may
      disagree). Ingredients not allowed include legumes (e.g. beans and
      lentils), grains, dairy, refined sugar, and processed foods.</p>
      <h5>Primal</h5>
      <p>Very similar to Paleo, except dairy is allowed - think raw and full fat milk,
      butter, ghee, etc.</p>
      <h5>Low FODMAP</h5>
      <p>FODMAP stands for "fermentable oligo-, di-,
      mono-saccharides and polyols". Our ontology knows which foods are
      considered high in these types of carbohydrates (e.g. legumes, wheat, and
      dairy products)</p>
      <h5>Whole30</h5>
      <p>Allowed ingredients include meat, fish/seafood,
      eggs, vegetables, fresh fruit, coconut oil, olive oil, small amounts of
      dried fruit and nuts/seeds. Ingredients not allowed include added
      sweeteners (natural and artificial, except small amounts of fruit juice),
      dairy (except clarified butter or ghee), alcohol, grains, legumes (except
      green beans, sugar snap peas, and snow peas), and food additives, such as
      carrageenan, MSG, and sulfites.</p></div>
