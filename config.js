//DONT USE THIS FILE- it's only for demo

// here you put your personal API Key, (which you have to put in quotation marks, because the Key can contain also letters), which you connect with the ".ingnore"-file , because you don't want to make your personal key visible for others. BUT: Because I already created this file and pushed the (empty) file to GitHub , the file is visible on GitHub.

// So if someone finds my project on GitHub and wants to take a look at the Code plus try it out, he has to create his own API and use it then in the project

// If you commited accidentally the API-Key to gitHub , you will be only be able to undo the last commit!

// const API_KEY = "";
